# R Recipes

Welcome to my list of R Recipes. I am using this space to upload interesting pieces of work I think it's convenient to clarify and even I want to dive deep. This reflects also my own learning journey in R and Data Science in general.

My intention is to upload recipes when time permits and without any fixed schedule.
