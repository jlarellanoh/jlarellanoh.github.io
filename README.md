# R Data Science 101

Welcome to R Data Science 101. I am using this space to upload interesting articles, R recipes, tricks or useful things I learn on the way. I am kind of new in the Data Science field but I have extensive experience with technology, data bases, visualization and mission critical services.

My intention is to upload content when time permits and without any fixed schedule.
